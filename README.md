**Retail Demand Forecasting with LSTM + Transformer: Project Plan**

**Overview:**
Build an end‑to‑end time‑series forecasting pipeline that predicts daily product sales across multiple stores, comparing LSTM and Transformer architectures and deploying a real‑time inference service.

**Objectives:**

1. Preprocess and feature engineer calendar and promotion data.
2. Develop and benchmark LSTM baseline forecasting model.
3. Implement Transformer encoder for improved long‑range dependency modeling.
4. Deploy best model via FastAPI + Docker, with a user dashboard.
5. Automate retraining pipeline with drift detection and CI/CD.

**Datasets & Tools:**

* **Dataset:** Rossmann Store Sales (Kaggle) or Walmart Sales Forecasting dataset.
* **Frameworks:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), PyTorch/Keras, scikit‑learn.
* **Modeling:** LSTM (many‑to‑one), Transformer encoder with positional encoding.
* **Deployment:** FastAPI, Docker, Streamlit.
* **MLOps:** GitHub Actions for CI/CD, logging, and alerting.
* **Experiment Tracking:** Weights & Biases or CSV logs.
* **Compute:** GPU‑enabled VM or local GPU.

### **Week-by-Week Breakdown**

| Week                                             | Goals & Deliverables |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| **Week 1: Data Ingestion & Feature Engineering** |                      |

* Download and inspect dataset; define train/val/test splits using rolling windows.
* Engineer time series features: day‑of‑week, month, holidays, promotions, lag features, rolling means.
* Visualize seasonality and trends; handle missing data/outliers.
* **Deliverable:** Feature‑engineered dataset and EDA report (plots + summary statistics). |
  \| **Week 2: LSTM Baseline** |
* Build a many‑to‑one LSTM model ingesting last N days of features to predict next‑day sales.
* Experiment with sequence length (e.g., 30, 60 days), hidden dimensions, dropout.
* Train and evaluate using RMSE and MAPE on validation set.
* **Deliverable:** LSTM model code, training logs, and performance comparison to simple baselines (ARIMA or naive). |
  \| **Week 3: Transformer Encoder Model** |
* Implement a Transformer encoder for time series: create positional encodings suited for daily data.
* Compare pure Transformer vs. hybrid CNN+Transformer architectures.
* Tune hyperparameters: number of layers, heads, embedding dimension, learning rate.
* Evaluate on the same metrics (RMSE, MAPE) and compare to LSTM.
* **Deliverable:** Transformer model code and comparative evaluation report. |
  \| **Week 4: Deployment, Dashboard & MLOps** |
* Wrap best-performing model in a FastAPI service; Dockerize endpoint.
* Build a Streamlit dashboard for users to input store/product and view forecasts + confidence intervals.
* Set up GitHub Actions to automatically trigger retraining weekly or on drift alerts (track feature distribution/drift).
* **Deliverable:** Deployed demo (local or cloud), CI/CD pipelines, README with instructions and architectural diagram. |

**Milestones & Success Criteria:**

* **Milestone 1 (End of Week 1):** Clean, feature‑rich dataset with documented EDA.
* **Milestone 2 (End of Week 2):** LSTM model outperforming simple baseline by ≥10% in RMSE.
* **Milestone 3 (End of Week 3):** Transformer model further improves RMSE/MAPE or offers other benefits (e.g., stability).
* **Milestone 4 (End of Week 4):** Live demo dashboard, automated retraining pipeline, and polished documentation.

**Next Steps:**

1. Initialize GitHub repo with folder structure and requirements.txt.
2. Provision compute environment (colab or cloud VM) and install dependencies.
3. Start Week 1: ingest data and prototype feature engineering notebook.
4. Schedule weekly check‑ins to track progress against milestones.

Let’s get started: which dataset will you choose (Rossmann vs. Walmart), and do you need help setting up the initial notebooks and repo structure?
